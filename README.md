# Neural Network Application Game Monitor Tool.README

The Neural Network Application Game Monitor Tool, also known as the "遊戲監視器小幫手," is a program developed to provide convenience to game players who want to stay updated on game developments without being in front of their computers all the time.

The goal of this project is to automatically monitor game updates and send email notifications to users when important content is detected by the system. In future versions, I plan to integrate object detection algorithms and edge computing concepts to improve speed and optimize system performance.

## Key Features

- Element location detection and dataset splitting from screenshots.
- Model training using existing datasets.
- Prediction of various game elements.
- Email notifications to inform users.
- Recognition of remaining time.

## Technology Stack

- Python programming language
- TensorFlow-GPU
- Keras
- VGG16 model
- Computer vision techniques
- AI classification
- Mail server integration

These technologies combined make the Neural Network Application Game Monitor Tool a powerful and potentially versatile solution.
